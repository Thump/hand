Overview
--------

  Hand is a tool for starting applications by hand.  It can be used
in a network-enabled mode, in which a common daemon is used to spawn
and reap children, or can be used in standalone mode for security
conscious users.


Description
-----------

  A cursory examination of the applications common on many Unix systems
will reveal a plethora of applications and utilities which must be started
by hand: the man pages for exmh, ftp, and infocmp, among many others,
all make reference to the hand daemon.  Unfortunately, this daemon is
not widely distributed, and has not heretofore been available on any
free Unix or Unix-like operating systems.

  With the release of this package, users of free operating systems will
have access to a full source hand daemon, which can be used to easily
start wide variety of stand-along applications, background tasks, and
X-Window software packages.


Modes of Operation
------------------

  The hand daemon can be used in either networked, or secure mode.
In network mode, the hand client utilizes a background hand daemon
to facilitate task execution.  When the client starts it will make
contact with the running daemon, pass to it the full list of arguments,
and allow the daemon to actually start the application.  By using a
central daemon in this fashion, system overhead and process space can be
conserved.

  If there is no hand daemon running at the time of client execution,
the client will seamlessly spawn off a daemon in the background.  This
daemon will be used to service that client's request, and will also be
available for other hand users.

  In security conscious environments, users may not wish this background
daemon to be used to service requests.  Users may feel the inter-process
communication channels have been compromised, or that the hand daemon
itself has been co-opted by a malicious party.  In this situation, the
hand client can be run in secure (-s) mode: it will not contact the
hand daemon, and will instead service the user's request and then exit.
While this present a higher system load, due to multiple client instances
starting applications individually, the resulting security may be of
sufficient attraction to over-ride this concern.


Usage
-----

hand [-d] [-v <#>] [-p <#>] [-F <cfg>] [-L <log>] [-s] [-b] -- <program> <args>

where:
        -d : enables debug mode
        -v : sets the verbosity level to <vl>
        -p : sets the port to <port>
        -F : uses <config> as the configuration file
        -L : uses <log> as the log file
        -s : runs client in secure (standalone) mode
        -b : start in background (internal use)
